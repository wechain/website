      title: 'About Vue Vixens',
      content: `{medium} is an initiative founded by {jen}, Developer Advocate at
              {progress}, that creates and hosts workshops to teach
              Vue.js to under-represented people in a cool and fun way.
              It is based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular
              community ({ngGirls}) who was in turn
              inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives.
              The format involves self-driven code labs completed in a workshop format
              in groups with mentoring by conference-goers and speakers who volunteer to help.
              The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such
              with Vue.js in a supportive and inclusive environment. We also help conferences organize
              their diversity initiatives such as offering free conference tickets, and are building a scholarship
              fund to help offset those attendees' conference costs so that they can more easily attend.

        paragraph1: `What can you expect from a Vue Vixens event? Well, as a student, perhaps new
              to the field of frontend development, you are given the opportunity to learn
              about Vue.js, a cool, fresh framework for building both web and mobile apps. Over
              the course of a breakfast, a lunch 'n' learn, or a full day, you'll work with a
              mentor in small groups in a self-driven workshop.
              You'll complete the task of building
              a web app and a mobile app that will teach you about the framework and programming in
              JavaScript.
              You'll also get a chance to meet and work with like-minded students and interface with
              leaders in the industry - our mentors are often speakers at the conference you attend.`,
        paragraph2: `{mentorsNote}: if you're joining a Vue Vixens skulk as a mentor, firstly, thank
              you! Because of you, we can offer
              free workshops to new developers in a supportive environment. Your job is to stay with your
              mentees throughout
              the day, helping them over any difficulties and giving them a view of the life of a seasoned
              professional
              developer. You're the best!
              Just to be clear, anyone can be a mentor for Vue Vixens! We are grateful for your participation.`,
        mentorsNote: `A note to mentors`,
        paragraph3: `{studentsNote}: unsure if you will fit into a Vue Vixens skulk? If you are a new
              Vue.js developer who uses the pronouns "she" or "they", you
              are welcome. We hate to leave anyone out, but this group is for women, and those who
              identify as such. We are trans-friendly.
              The founder of Vue Vixens, Jen Looper, is a Wellesley College Alumna (class of '92) and
              takes the college's admission criteria
              as a blueprint. To paraphrase their statement of admissibility:`,
        studentsNote: 'A note to students',
        paragraph4: `"We will admit any person who lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman;
              therefore, candidates assigned male at birth
              who identify as women are eligible. We also welcome those who were assigned female at birth
              and who feel they belong in our community of women.
              We seek to provide students with a uniquely empowering learning environment—one designed
              specifically to prepare women to thrive in a complex world."`,
